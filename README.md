**Project Summary:**

The idea behind this app is a virtual assistant that can respond to commands given verbally. We wanted to imitate the 
functionality of google voice commands and Apple's Siri. We have integrated several libraries that gives our virtual 
assistant the power to server dyanmic content. 

This project was made with Python as the backend and Django as the framework. It is hosted on an 
AWS Ec2 instance of Ubuntu 16 and is run with Nginix. The content that is returned is the reuslt of several different 
API that that application queries with commands from the user.
